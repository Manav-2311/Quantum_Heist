# Quantum_Heist
The idea for Quantum Heist stemmed from a fascination with quantum mechanics and its mind-bending principles like superposition and entanglement. These concepts sparked the vision of a futuristic heist game where players must solve quantum puzzles while navigating procedurally generated environments. The rapid advancements in quantum computing and AWS's robust cloud-based services provided the perfect tools to bring this vision to life.

We were also inspired by the growing potential of multiplayer gaming and the integration of technologies like machine learning, IoT, and blockchain to create deeply immersive and unique player experiences.
